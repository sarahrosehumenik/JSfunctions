# Javascript Functions
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/0*IdTcxUwLw77wSkUi.jpg)

## Objective: 
- We will be able to Declare and call a JavaScript function.

## üìñ JavaScript recap before diving into JavaScript functions 

### Data Types! 
- What are Javascript Data Types? Lets refresh! 

- primative data types: 
Number, String, Boolean, NULL, Undefined and Symbol

- non-primative data types:
Objects! An object can hold a collection of data. 

### ‚ùì What data type is an array and why? An array may look like:
    let array = [‚Äúhi‚Äù, true, 123, ‚Äúim one data type of many in this array‚Äù]

    <p><strong> Object! An array lets you store multiple values in a single variable. </strong></p>

## What is a function?
### - A function is a reusable block of code written to preform a single purpose

Examples:

```js
// Get player's choice of board size (S for small, M for medium, L for large)
 function getBoardSize() {
   const validChoices = ['S', 'M', 'L'];
   let size;
   while (!validChoices.includes(size)) {
     size = prompt('Enter the board size (S)mall, (M)edium or (L)arge: ').toUpperCase();
   }
   return size;
 }
``` 
 
 - If the user enters "M" in the prompt, the return on the function will be "M". We now can use that information anywhere that is needed and is stored in our function. 

```js
//Notice the use of parameters in this function

 function getPointsScored(elapsedTime) {
   if (elapsedTime < 30) {
     return 100;
   } else if (elapsedTime < 60) {
     return 75;
   } else {
     return 25;
   }
 }
 //we also have to provide parameters in the call
 const points = getPointsScored(time);
 ```
 
 ‚ùì If time = 25 how many points will the function return?

    <p><strong> 100!  </strong></p>

- functions are the primary building blocks of programs
- the code in a function does not execute until the function is called, however the code is checked for syntax errors when the script file is loaded. 
- programming languages also include built in functions! for example <code>  .toUpperCase()  </code> as seen in the first example. 
- To add to what we know, it is common practice for a function to call on other functions. 

Example: 

```js
 let size, board;
 
 function initialize() {
   size = getBoardSize();
   board = generateBoard(size);
   renderBoard();
 }
 ```
 
 ## ‚ÄºÔ∏è questions check point! 

 ## Okay i get what a function is but why? 
 
 1. Functions allow us as developers to break up programs into more managable blocks of code.
 2. We can reuse functions because they can be called as many times as neccessary in a program. 
 - for example, we may want to rerender the board based on changing data. 
 3. Functions help create DRY code by not repeating code in multiple places. "Don't Repeat Yourself".
 4. Using clear naming functions help with making readable and debuggable code. 
 
 
  
 ‚ùìI made a function named <code> function nums() </code>. This function is going to multiply two numbers. Is this function good naming convention?
 <details>	
    <summary>Answer...</summary>
    <p><strong> A better naming convention would be something like <code>function multiplyTwoNums()</code>. This will help you know what the code is doing before reading the code block</strong></p>

 # Lets Practice!
 
 We will use the coding playground [replit.com](https://replit.com/)
- Make an account if you don't have one already.
- Create a new node.js repl and name it "JS Functions".
- Okay, now lets get started!
 
### Practice 1: 
together we are going to make a function that adds two numbers together. We are going to include <strong>Parameters</strong>! The parameters of "a,b". When we call the function It will return a console.log that adds two numbers we give the call. 

### Practice 2:
- Your turn! üïê One minute

You are now going to write a function that returns a console.log() of a string that says "Hello World!". Hint: this function does not require parameters! remember to use clear naming convention. 
- Bonus: make another function that returns "Hello World" using parameters.

## Types of functions!

We have been using function declarations/definitions but there are other forms of declaring functions! 
The three primary:

1. Function Declaration/Definitions
Example: 

```js
//you can call a declaration function before or after its been defined! they are hoisted to the top of their scope 
fnDeclaration()

function fnDeclaration() {
  console.log("I'm coming from a function declaration");
}
 ```
 
 2. Function Expressions

```js
//function expressions cannot be called before they are defined
fnExpression();  // TypeError: fnExpression is not a function
const fnExpression = function() {
  console.log("I'm coming from a function expression");
};
```

3. Arrow Functions

```js
// Function Declaration
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow Function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

```

- arrow functions offer a more clean syntax and an implicit return though we will go more into Arrow Functions at another time!
